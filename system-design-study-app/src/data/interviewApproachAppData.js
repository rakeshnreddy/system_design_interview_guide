For redirection, the application server looks up the short alias in the database and issues an HTTP 301 (permanent) or 302 (temporary) redirect. Caching frequently accessed short URLs (e.g., in Memcached/Redis in front of the main DB) would be critical for read latency." },

For custom aliases, we need to ensure they are unique, which might add write latency." },
