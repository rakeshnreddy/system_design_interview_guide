  overview: `Asynchronous messaging is a communication method where senders (producers) and receivers (consumers) of messages do not need to interact at the same time. Producers place messages into a queue, and consumers retrieve them when ready, allowing components to be decoupled and operate independently. This decoupling is fundamental to building resilient and scalable distributed systems.

Queues enhance distributed systems by improving reliability, throughput, and durability. Reliability is increased because messages persist in the queue even if consumers are temporarily unavailable, ensuring eventual processing. Throughput benefits as producers can offload tasks quickly without waiting for immediate processing, and multiple consumers can process messages in parallel. Durability is achieved by persisting messages, protecting against data loss in case of system failures, ensuring that critical information is not lost before it can be acted upon.`,
