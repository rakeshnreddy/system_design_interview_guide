  overview: `Asynchronous messaging is a communication method where senders (producers) and receivers (consumers) of messages do not need to interact at the same time. Producers place messages into a queue, and consumers retrieve them when ready, allowing components to be {{Decoupling|decoupled}} and operate independently. This {{Decoupling}} is fundamental to building {{Resilient Systems|resilient}} and {{Scalable Systems|scalable}} distributed systems.

Queues enhance distributed systems by improving {{Reliability}}, {{Throughput}}, and {{Durability}}. {{Reliability}} is increased because messages persist in the queue even if consumers are temporarily unavailable, ensuring eventual processing. {{Throughput}} benefits as producers can offload tasks quickly without waiting for immediate processing, and multiple consumers can process messages in parallel. {{Durability}} is achieved by persisting messages, protecting against data loss in case of system failures, ensuring that critical information is not lost before it can be acted upon.`,
