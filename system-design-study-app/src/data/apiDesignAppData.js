  title: "API Design",
  overview: `An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In system design, APIs are the fundamental building blocks for creating modular, scalable, and maintainable systems. They define how various components of a system, or different systems altogether, interact, exchange data, and invoke functionality without needing to know the intricacies of each other's internal implementations. This abstraction enables decoupling, promotes reusability, and facilitates integration between disparate services, whether they are internal microservices or external third-party services.

APIs are the backbone of modern software, enabling services like Google Maps, Twitter, and Stripe to expose their functionality and data for integration into other applications.

APIs can be broadly categorized as synchronous or asynchronous. {{Synchronous APIs}} require the client to send a request and wait for an immediate response from the server. This blocking nature is suitable for operations where the client needs a quick confirmation or data to proceed, like retrieving user details. In contrast, {{Asynchronous APIs}} allow the client to send a request and continue processing without waiting for an immediate response; the server processes the request in the background and notifies the client upon completion, often via {{Webhooks}} or [message queues](#/messaging-queues). The choice between synchronous and asynchronous design significantly impacts system responsiveness, resource utilization, and {{Fault Tolerance}}. For example, long-running tasks like video processing are better suited for asynchronous APIs to avoid tying up client resources, while quick data lookups benefit from synchronous interaction. Design choices here are crucial for user experience and system efficiency.`,
