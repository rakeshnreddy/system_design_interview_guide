  title: "Load Balancing",
  overview: "Load balancing is the strategic distribution of incoming network or application traffic across multiple backend servers (also known as a server farm or server pool). This process is critical for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing {{Throughput}}, minimizing response time ({{Latency}}), and ensuring {{High Availability}} for applications. \n\n**Key Goals of Load Balancing:**\n*   **Improved {{Availability}} & Reliability:** By distributing traffic, if one server fails, the load balancer automatically redirects requests to healthy servers, preventing service outages.\n*   **Enhanced {{Scalability}}:** Allows systems to scale horizontally by adding more servers to the pool as demand increases, without overwhelming individual servers.\n*   **Increased {{Performance}} & Reduced {{Latency}}:** Prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck, leading to faster response times for users. Some load balancers can also direct users to geographically closer servers (see {{Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)}}).\n*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Ensures that server resources are used efficiently, preventing some servers from being idle while others are overloaded.\n*   **Simplified Maintenance:** Servers can be taken offline for maintenance or upgrades without impacting overall application availability, as the load balancer will route traffic away from them.\n\nA load balancer acts as a 'traffic director' positioned in front of your servers. It receives client requests and, based on a configured algorithm (e.g., {{Round Robin}}, {{Least Connections}}), forwards these requests to an appropriate backend server. {{Health Checks}} are continuously performed to monitor server status, ensuring traffic is only sent to operational servers.",
