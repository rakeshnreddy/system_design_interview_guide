  title: "Load Balancing",
  overview: "Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic evenly across a pool of backend servers. This ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed, which could lead to slow performance or even service failure. By spreading the load, a load balancer improves application responsiveness, availability, and scalability. It acts as a traffic cop, sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers, and when a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer automatically starts to send requests to it. In this way, a load balancer performs the following functions: distributes client requests or network load efficiently across multiple servers; ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online; provides the flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates.",
